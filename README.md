Closing the Gap speeches, Australian Senate Hansard text, 46th - 44th Parliaments
This repository contains text files of speeches made in the Australian Senate between 2014 and 2021 in response to the Prime Minister's statement about the Closing the Gap report. The speeches have been taken from Hansard (available from www.aph.gov.au as PDF files) and collected into Parliaments (44th: 2014 - 2016; 45th: 2017 - 2019; 46th: 2020 - 2021).
Further, the repository has a file of graphs, wordclouds, and lexical dispersion plots made using quanteda R package to examine word frequency in the speeches.
